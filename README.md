# McGill Projects

**A place for people who love building powerful tools.**


We founded this community for developers, designers, and engineers to connect and build impactful tools. We aim to make good tools for our friends, families, ourselves, and the world.

You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. We strive to think from first principles with creativity. We learn, build and share with others.
