# McGill Projects Vision


***We founded this community to build a place for passionate developers, designers, and engineers to learn, build, and share.***

We are building a culture for contrarian, first-principled, and creative people who dare to challenge the status quo and the world's most critical problems. We aim to create good gifts for the world: make good art, write good software, and build good products for ourselves and our friends. 
 
This is a place for hard-working, intelligent, energetic, and integrous people to play long-term games with long-term people. **We learn, build, and share with others.**
