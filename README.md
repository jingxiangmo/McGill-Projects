# McGill Projects Manifesto

***We founded this community on the vision of building a place for developers, designers, and engineers to connect and build cool projects with cool people.***

Having the right environment is the most important. As the old saying goes, you are the average of your five closest friends. We must work on things that matter. It doesn't have to be a non-profit charity. It's things that are more important than money. We aim to make gifts for the world: make good art, write good software, and build good products for ourselves and our friends. Do not be intimidated by the difficulty of the problems. Play long-term games with long-term people. Learn, build, and share.
